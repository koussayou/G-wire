        <p style="color: black; font-size: small;">Fire and smoke kill more people every year than many other forces. While controlled fire serves us in so many instances, uncontrolled fire can be of harm, however, the rapid detection of fire and its control can save lives and property damage worth millions. Conventional and addressable are two main types of fire alarm systems, but unfortunately, these fire alarm systems often generate false alarms. The ratio of false alarm is higher in conventional alarm systems compared to addressable, but addressable alarm fire systems are more expensive. The most likely cause of a false warning is different for distinct types of detection systems, such as a smoke sensor often being activated falsely due to an environmental effect. So, there is a need for a cost-effective multi-sensors expert alarm system that is artificially trained and assists FDWS (fire detection and warning system) to make the right decisions and to reduce the number of false alarms. False alarm warnings are so common that London fire brigade alone is called out almost every 10 min to attend a false alarm causing them a loss of about Â£37 million per year. To achieve the aforementioned goal, in this paper, we introduced a home-based FDMS that uses a microcontroller Arduino UNO R3 (Arduino, Somerville, TX, USA) based on the atmega328p. It is easily available and programmed using the Arduino Software (IDE) with a set of cost-effective sensors. The proposed solution effectively uses a smoke sensor with flame sensors with a particular increase in room temperature; to further investigate the true presence of fire and to avoid false alarm, the FDWS is trained with a neuro-fuzzy designer. The purpose of this intelligent fire alarm system is to sense true occurrences of fire, alert the proper authorities, and notify the occupants via GSM to take necessary action immediately. </p>

      <p style="color: black;font-size: small;">For generating an intelligent fire detection system that can monitor the parameters required for the actual presence of fire so that a false alarm can be decreased up to a minimum level, a combination of two important technologies fuzzy logic and artificial neural network (Ann) called the adaptive neural fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) can logically generate fuzzy rules according to training data to make the system robust. A fire detection system is developed using this aforementioned technology and presented in this paper to find the probability of fire. The ANFIS neural network works until the output matches the desired value for the given input. So, considering these abilities, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system is used for detection of fire.

        ANFIS is a five-layer architecture that was developed in the early 1990s. The first layer is called the input layer. The second layer of ANFIS, called inputmf, is a fixed input membership function layer. The third layer depicts norms. The fourth layer, outputmf, is a fixed output membership function layer and the last is the output. The basic block diagram of ANFIS with input and output is illustrated in Figure 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
        The input-output fuzzy membership functions are analyzed in detail. The generated 3D graphs show the variation of fire chances with reference to the changes in different parameters at input sides such as variation with temperature and humidity, time and humidity, smoke and temperature, and smoke and humidity are shown in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.
